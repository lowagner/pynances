mbf:
    allow for transfers between categories, e.g. between disc-A and disc-L for "tipping."

    Tab completion on the pynances command line.

qif:
    make checkbox for "Edit File With Single Click".  
        if toggled, if you click on an account, it will go to that one to edit the file.
        if not toggled, you have to double click.

    Ctrl+O will open a file dialog to edit a file.

    Close Without Saving? dialog for when textEdit has been modified.

Random mostly incomprehensible notes:

Get rid of adding up totals (probably is already in the month)

Make difference between budget and spending for non-business
Also possibly give what's left

remove accounts from config.py
read in all files from that month, ascertain if they are an account from that metaword.
determine the name of the account by something like this at the top of the file:
    account Savings
or
    account Capital One Savings

also include a "business" metaword.
    business

better parsing:  
    if there's an error, quit program and give line number and print out line which was problem!
    if there's multiple "from"s or "paid"s on a line, only use the last one to designate the dough.
        could look backwards through the line split.

allow for transfers between categories, e.g. between disc-A and disc-L for "tipping."

mbf:
    internally convert moneys to integers, doing integer arithmetic with pennies instead of floats.
    inside the config file can give default precision (2 for standard use cases),
    as well as a precision for each currency.

qif:
    make checkbox for "Edit File With Single Click".  
        if toggled, if you click on an account, it will go to that one to edit the file.
        if not toggled, you have to double click.

    Ctrl+O will open a file dialog to edit a file.

    linux needs more room for the command edit line.

    Close Without Saving? dialog for when textEdit has been modified.


Tab completion on the pynances command line.

Why on mac does on_text get called before on_key_press?

Random mostly incomprehensible notes:

Get rid of adding up totals (probably is already in the month)
for the accounts.  but probably ok if we don't

Make difference between budget and spending for non-business
Also possibly give what's left

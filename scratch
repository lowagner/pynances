scratch file

Edit files by typing "e(dit) file" into command line.  
You can get to this scratch file by typing "e" without any file.
Quit by ctrl+w or ctrl+q.  

Save files by first typing escape (to get out of editing mode) and then
typing "s" or "save" into command line.

THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT NOTICE IF YOU CHANGE AND DO NOT SAVE!
(so remember to save.  I forgot to save that last bit once.)
If you forgot which file you were editting, type in "w" or "which" into command line.
